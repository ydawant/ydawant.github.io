            <a name="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who Am I?</h3>

            <p>Hey! My name is Yannick, a graduate from the first Chicago cohort (AKA a Squirrel) of Dev Bootcamp - Chicago. I hail from the gorgeous Nashville, TN but I've been a proud resident of Chicago for almost six years. I graduated from Northwestern with a degree in mechanical engineering in 2011. I worked as an applications engineer for two years, before diverging paths into a career in web development. </p>

            <h3>
              <a name="how-did-i-get-here" class="anchor" href="#how-did-i-get-here"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Did I Get Here?</h3>

              <p>Post college, I quickly jumped into a career doing applications engineering in the Chicago suburbs. The company was a small, family owned operation. I was the head (by way of being the only) applications engineer - pretty sweet gig for a 21 year old right out of college. We made screws ("fasteners" for the connoisseur) and it was not as straight forward as you may think. However, after about two years, I realized that I was not doing what I was passionate about (the fastener world isn't for everyone, after all). Although I loved manufacturing, the company, and my role in the company, I wasn't learning. I felt stagnant and unchallenged. I started working on a side project - a website with one of my friends. This brought back my energy. I was doing what I wanted to do again. I was creating, problem-solving, learning, and even -dare I say it -enjoying every minute of it. The issue is that it was <strong>slow</strong> progress. That tends to happen when neither of us actually knew the first thing about web development. This led to a desperate search to learn more and eventually I decided that I loved it enough to take a risk and took a leap of faith into Dev Bootcamp.</p>

                <p>Have you made it this far? I'm impressed. So let's continue... I think that I have several things to offer a potential employer - maybe the most important being my award-winning smile and toothpick-sized legs. Closely following that, I think that my focus, voracious appetite for learning, willingness to be wrong, compassion, empathy, work ethic, positive attitude and knack for run-on sentences are vital. </p>

                <p> A couple of the projects I have worked on...<br><br>
                  <strong>Flickr Jr.</strong> - Flickr Jr. was my first real dive into a full project. I implemented users, public and private albums, friends, likes, comments, as well as the implementation of carrierwave. I worked on making a custom carousel for my albums as well as dynamic forms. It is still super rough, but was a good starter project for me. You can check the source code on <a href="https://github.com/ydawant/flickr_jr">GitHub</a></p>

                  <p><strong>groupact</strong> - My final project at DBC, named <a href="http://www.groupact.me">groupact</a>, was a 9 day long sprint in a team of three. This was our second attempt at a full Ruby on Rails app, as well as our most involved. Beyond the obvious of learning an absolute ton about Rails, the most important takeaways were the teamwork, communication, shared vision, github integration, and FEEDBACK. Please take a look at the source code on <a href="https://github.com/dontmitch/group_planning">GitHub</a></p>

                  <p>The skills that I have acquired over the last 9 weeks include Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Javascript (mostly JQuery and a touch of Backbone)</p>
