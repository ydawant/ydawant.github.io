<a name="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who Am I?</h3>

<p>My name is Yannick Dawant, a graduate from the first Chicago cohort of Dev Bootcamp. I am a resident of Chicago and have been every since graduating from Northwestern as a mechanical engineer. Before Dev Bootcamp I worked as such for two years before diverging paths into a hopeful career in web development. </p>

<a name="how-did-i-get-here" class="anchor" href="#how-did-i-get-here"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Did I Get Here?</h3>

<p>After graduating from college, I quickly jumped into a career doing applications engineering in the Chicago suburbs. The company was a small family owned operation and I was the head (by way of being the only..) applications engineer - pretty sweet gig for a 21 year old right out of college. We made screws ("fasteners" for the connaisseur) and it was not as straight forward as you may think. However, after about two years of doing that, I realized that I was not doing what I was passionate about (the fastener world isn't for everyone, after all.) I felt stagnant and unchallenged. I started working on a side project - a website with one of my friends. This brought back my energy. I was doing what I wanted to do again. I was creating, problem-solving, learning, and even -dare I say it -enjoying every minute of it. The issue is that it was <strong>slow</strong> progress. That tends to happen when neither of us actually knew the first thing about web development. This led to a desperate search to learn more and eventually I decided that I loved it enough to take a risk and took a leap of faith into Dev Bootcamp.</p>

<p>Have you made it this far? I'm impressed. So let's continue... I think that I have several things to offer a potential employer - maybe the most important being my award-winning smile and toothpick-sized legs. Closely following that, I think that my focus, voracious appetite for learning, willingness to be wrong, compassion, empathy, work ethic, positive attitude and knack for run-on sentences are vital. </p>

<p>The skills that I have acquired over the last 9 weeks include Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Javascript (mostly JQuery and a touch of Backbone)</p>
